      <p>Secret Agent James Bond 007 is once again on the trail of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. mastermind Ernst Stavro
         Blofeld, who plans to unleash a deadly virus on an unsuspecting world. Meantime, he falls in love.
        Ask any 007 connoisseur that age old question about which is the best James Bond movie and the answer
        they are likely to give is this one, the 6th in the series and the one only to star the face of Fry’s 
        chocolate, Australian himbo George Lazenby in the signature role. For whatever Lazenby’s limitations as an actor 
        (rule of thumb, he’s good at action, stilted at everything else), this is the Bond flick blessed with the best plot, a genuine 
        sense of emotion and a spirit closest to Ian Fleming’s novels that have seen it grow in critical/fan stature in the years 
        since its release where it was greeted with outright derision.

  <p>Goldfinger is a 1964 spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the ill-fated Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.

    The film's plot has Bond investigating gold smuggling by gold magnate Auric Goldfinger and eventually uncovering Goldfinger's plans to contaminate the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. Goldfinger was the first Bond blockbuster, with a budget equal to that of the two preceding films combined. Principal photography took place from January to July 1964 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United States.
